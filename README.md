📁 Cloud-Based Document Management System using AWS OpenSearch
This project demonstrates a serverless, scalable architecture for managing documents using AWS services. It enables uploading, indexing, searching, and retrieving documents—all in a fully automated cloud environment without managing servers.

🚀 Project Overview
Pipeline Components:

Amazon S3 – Stores uploaded documents (PDF, TXT).

AWS Lambda – Extracts text and indexes content in real time.

Amazon OpenSearch Service – Enables full-text search across documents.

AWS API Gateway – Exposes secure endpoints for search queries.

AWS IAM – Manages roles and access permissions.

Amazon CloudWatch – Monitors logs, metrics, and system performance.

🔧 Services Used
AWS Lambda (Python)

Amazon S3

Amazon OpenSearch Service

AWS API Gateway

AWS IAM

Amazon CloudWatch

🛠️ How to Use
1. Upload Documents via S3
Upload files like about_design_v2.txt etc.., to a designated S3 bucket.

2. Lambda Processes Files
Triggered on upload, Lambda extracts text and indexes content in OpenSearch.

3. Search Using API
Use API Gateway or tools like Postman to query documents by keyword (e.g., “design”).

4. Monitor with CloudWatch
Track logs, detect errors, and optimize resource usage in real-time.
